    "### Minimax Algorithm\n",
    "Minimax is a kind of backtracking algorithm that is used in decision making and game theory to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that your opponent also plays optimally. It is widely used in two player turn-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Backgammon, Mancala, Chess, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Minimax the two players are called **maximizer** and **minimizer**. The maximizer tries to get the highest score possible while the minimizer tries to do the opposite and get the lowest score possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every board state has a value associated with it. In a given state if the maximizer has upper hand then, the score of the board will tend to be some positive value. If the minimizer has the upper hand in that board state then it will tend to be some negative value. The values of the board are calculated by some heuristics which are unique for every type of game.\n",

    "\n",
    "The number of possible sequences are the facorial value and the amount of cells avaiable. The Tic Tac Toe starts with 9 avaible cells, after a cell is occupied, the amount of aviable cells decreases to 8, and so on. This means the first move have 9 different possibilities, after this all of theese 9 possibilities have 8 new possibilities and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Factorial\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, the factorial of a positive integer $n$, denoted by $n!$, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $n$:\n",
    "\n",
    "_Formula_\n",
    "$$n! = \\underbrace{n\\times(n-1)\\times(n-2)\\times(n-3)\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot\\times(n-n+1)}_\\text{$n$ times}$$\n",

    "#### Horizon effect\n",
    "The **horizon effect**, also known as the **horizon problem**, is a problem in artificial intelligence whereby, in many games, the number of possible states or positions is immense and computers can only feasibly search a small portion of them, typically a few plies down the game tree. Thus, for a computer searching only five plies, there is a possibility that it will make a detrimental move, but the effect is not visible because the computer does not search to the depth of the error _(i.e., beyond its \"horizon\")_.\n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating a large game tree using techniques such as minimax with alpha-beta pruning, search depth is limited for feasibility reasons. However, evaluating a partial tree may give a misleading result. When a significant change exists just over the horizon of the search depth, the computational device falls victim to the horizon effect.\n",

    "### Node Tree\n",
    "In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data type (ADT) that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tree data structure can be defined recursively as a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of references to nodes (the \"children\"), with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures. A tree can be empty with no nodes or a tree is a structure consisting of one node called the root and zero or one or more subtrees.\n",

    "### Alpha-Beta Pruning\n",
    "Alpha-Beta pruning is not actually a new algorithm, rather an optimization technique for minimax algorithm. It reduces the computation time by a huge factor. This allows us to search much faster and even go into deeper levels in the game tree. It cuts off branches in the game tree which need not be searched because there already exists a better move available. It is called Alpha-Beta pruning because it passes 2 extra parameters in the minimax function, namely alpha and beta.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alpha is the best value that the **maximizer** currently can guarantee at that level or above.  \n",
    "Beta is the best value that the **minimizer** currently can guarantee at that level or above.\n",
